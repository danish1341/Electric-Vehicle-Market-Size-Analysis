# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Size-Analysis

This project conducts a detailed market size analysis of the Electric Vehicles (EV) industry in the United States using Python. Market size analysis is essential for understanding potential demand, market saturation, and growth opportunities, especially in industries like EVs that are rapidly evolving.
This analysis focuses on the Electric Vehicle population in the United States and follows a structured approach to estimate market size, growth rates, and potential opportunities. The methodology includes defining the market scope, data collection, analytical modeling, and presenting the findings through visualizations.

# Key Fetures Considereed during Project 
* Data Collection: Data is gathered from reliable sources such as government publications, industry associations (e.g., IEA, BloombergNEF), and market research firms. These sources provide valuable insights into the historical and current trends in EV sales, production, and market growth.
* Data Cleaning & Preparation: Raw data is processed and cleaned for analysis using Pandas.
* Data Visualization: Visualizes key findings, trends, and forecasts using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Key Tasks
* EV Adoption Over Time: Analyzed the growth of the Electric Vehicle population by model year.
* Geographical Distribution: Understood through Visualization Plots that where EVs are most commonly registered by country or city.
* EV Types: Breakdowned the dataset by electric vehicle type BEV or PHEV.
* Make and Model Popularity: Identified the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.
* Electric Range Analysis: Analyzed the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
* Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles

# EV Adoption Over Time Analysis using Line Plot
The bar chart clearly illustrates the steady increase in EV adoption over time, with a particularly noticeable upward trend beginning around 2016. Up until that point, the number of registered electric vehicles grows at a modest pace. However, starting in 2017, there is a marked acceleration in the rate of growth.

This sharp rise can be attributed to several factors, including advancements in EV technology, increasing consumer awareness of environmental concerns, government incentives, and an expanding infrastructure of charging stations. The trend continues to gain momentum, and by 2023, the chart reveals a significant surge in EV registrations. In fact, the bar for 2023 is the highest on the graph, indicating a peak in EV adoption during this period.

This dramatic increase in 2023 could be the result of key developments such as the introduction of more affordable EV models, improvements in battery range, and a stronger push towards reducing carbon emissions. These factors, combined with favorable policies and heightened demand for sustainable transportation, have likely contributed to this peak in EV registrations.
